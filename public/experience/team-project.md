As part of the Computer Science course, students are required to undertake a team project in 3rd year. Each team works with a real client to deliver a product by the end of the year. We have to manage the project by ourselves - this involves scheduling meetings, managing client expectations, delivering regular updates, and much more.

My team and I worked with the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC) to develop a web application for them to manage data from Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) experiments. I oversaw the development of a Django web application using a sqlite database for the backend to solve this problem.

We followed an agile methodology with weekly meetings and monthly client meetings and retrospectives. Throughout the project we adhered to professional software development practices, and delivered a finished product to the client at the end of the year, as well as delivering a presentation on the product.

We faced several challenges throughout the project, the main one being the unpredictability of the data. We had a massive amount of data provided by the client and trying to generalise fields to design an apt database for the data was a big challenge since for each assumption we made, there was always some counterexample. The data was very extensive and we didn't always know what each column in the dataset meant, so deferred to the client's judgement for several fields.
