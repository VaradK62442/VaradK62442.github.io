The <u><a href="https://lean-lang.org/">LEAN programming language</a></u> is a "proof assistant that enables correct, maintainable, and formally verified code". My first introduction to this language was <u><a href="https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/nng4">The Natural Number Game</a></u>, which takes the player through several seemingly elementary theorems in mathematics and having the player prove them with LEAN. This is an incredibly well-made resource and made me appreciate LEAN, especially its rigour and methods. I greatly enjoyed playing through the game and the reward of finding a proof of theorems that are very simple to state but difficult to prove rigorously, such as "2 + 2 != 5" was incredibly satisfying.

<br>

As I said, I love the rigorous and logical framework LEAN provides for mathematical proofs, and to continue this learning experience, I wanted to base my 4th year dissertation around LEAN to pursue it further. I am undertaking a project under supervision of Dr. Gethin Norman on formal verification using LEAN.

<u><a href="https://github.com/VaradK62442/lean">This</a></u> repository serves as a place for me to follow the <u><a href="https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/">Theorem Proving in LEAN</a></u> tutorial and learn the language for my dissertation.
