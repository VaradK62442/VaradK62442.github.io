In second year, during the Introduction to Object Oriented Programming (IOOP) course, we were taught Java through incrementally developing a game throughout the semester, by adding various features as we learned the language. The last assignment had a section in which we could implement any extra features we wanted, so I decided to make this a fully fleshed out game, and publish it on <u><a href="https://hades62442.itch.io/captain-pinkies-adventure">itch.io</a></u>.

A friend kindly made the art for the game, and I implemented several features that I thought would be fun and interesting to play with, including a Pirate boss.
