During the Robotics Foundations course, we were taught about several image processing approaches - mainly two different methods, one to transform an image with convolutions or other operations, and another to extract attributes from an image to use for comparison or generally as a metric.

To provide a break from revising by taking notes, as well as to strengthen my knowledge on the topic, I decided to implement these methods using the OpenCV library. I implemented various thresholding methods; several different convolutions including the Gabor kernel, motion blur, the Sobel kernel, and more; calculating image moments; finding the centroid and ellipsoid of an image; and a few more.
