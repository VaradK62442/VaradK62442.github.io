One of the projeccts I have wanted to create for a long time has been a text editor. Since I spend so much time in one, I constantly keep thinking of features I would like and things I could implement. So in an effort to build my ideal text editor, I decided to create Coaster.

I had wanted to learn Rust for a while, and this seemed like the perfect project to accomplish that. I found a great <u><a href="https://philippflenker.com/hecto-chapter-1/">tutorial</a></u> on building a text editor, and have followed and adapted it to my preferences, which are heavily inspired and influenced by Vim.
