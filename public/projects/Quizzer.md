When I was revising for some subjects that required memorisation, I wanted to use some sort of flashcard system to help me. As a way to take a break from revision, I decided to make a simple command line tool to help me with this task. I made it so that the questions and answers could be fed in from a JSON file, and the answers were checked by a simple (and often incorrect) word similarity checker.

After implementing some other small features (formatting and displaying results, choosing between multiple quiz files, shuffling questions, etc.), I posted the repository on a public Computer Science university chat, and found that several people used it, found it helpful, and even contributed questions and features to the app.
