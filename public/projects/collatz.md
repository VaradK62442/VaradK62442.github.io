The Collatz conjecture is a simple one to state, but mathematicians have spent countless hours trying to either prove or disprove it, and mathematicians are warned not to waste more time on it. It goes as follows.

<br>

Take any positive number. If it is even, divide it by 2. If it is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. The conjecture states that repeating this process will eventually lead to 1 (where applying the rule again leads to a cyclic sequence of 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1), starting with any number.

To explore and exposit about this conjecture, I made a program to generate plots of Collatz numbers and sequences, to aid in writing <u><a href="https://medium.com/@varadkulk123/the-collatz-conjecture-68130a357486" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this essay</a></u>.
