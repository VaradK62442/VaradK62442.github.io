As part of my research on Stable Matching and matching problems generally, I worked on implementing several matching algorithms and related utilities to release as a Python package. Our aim was to make using these algorithms as easy as possible since existing libraries provided a difficult interface to work with, as well as to provide strong documentation, guidelines, and benchmarks on the algorithms. The package includes implementations of several matching algorithms, including ones using Integer Linear Programming using the <u><a href="https://www.gurobi.com/">Gurobi</a></u> solver.
