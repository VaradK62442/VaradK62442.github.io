My first introduction to the LEAN programming language was <u><a href="https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/nng4">The Natural Number Game</a></u>, which takes the player through several seemingly elementary theorems in mathematics, using the Peano axioms to prove them with LEAN.

I greatly enjoyed playing through this and the reward of finding a proof of theorems such as "2 + 2 != 5" was incredibly satisfying. I love the rigorous and logical framework LEAN provides for mathematical proofs. To continue this learning experience, I decided to pursue LEAN further and use it in my 4th year dissertation. This repository serves as a place for me to follow the <u><a href="https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/">Theorem Proving in LEAN</a></u> tutorial and learn the language for my dissertation.
