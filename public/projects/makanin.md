During Summer 2024, I worked on researching into the field of word equations, specifically the existence and uniqueness of solutions of word equations in 2 letters. These equations simply consists of an unknown variable "x", and two letters, usually "a" and "b". Equations are of the form "xaab = baax", and the question lies in the existence and uniqueness of solutions. You can see in that example, we have the solution "x = b", as well as "x = baab".

There are a few existing algorithms, as well as a few algorithms my colleague and I came up with, that seemed to lend themselves to be implemented, and programming them helped advance our efforts in researching into this topic.
