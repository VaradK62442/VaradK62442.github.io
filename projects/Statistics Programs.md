During my first year, I took a couple of statistics modules. In these, we learned about several statistical processes and tests to carry out depending on the data and hypotheses one was wanting to test. To help me learn these processes, as well as improve my skills using tkinter and Python, I made a small app to take in inputs, run the selected tests, and display the results appropriately.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
    <img src="/media/stats.png" width="50%">
</div>

This tool helped me in the course greatly since I could use the program to aid in answering questions, the app helped to check my work, and programming in these tessts helped learn about them too.
