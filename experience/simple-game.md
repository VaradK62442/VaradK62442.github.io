For the 2024 Do You Have the Guts Hackathon, hosted by the Glasgow University Tech Society, the challenge posed by JP Morgan was to create a 'minimalist' or 'simple' game. In a team of 5, we had 24 hours to come up with an idea, learn an entire game engine, and implement our idea to fulfil this brief. We made <u><a href="https://github.com/VaradK62442/simplegame" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simple Game</a></u>, and <b>won</b> the JP Morgan challenge.

We decided to learn the game engine Godot, and after spending some time getting familiar with it, we came up with a bullet hell style game with simple polygons as the art. The player would be a square moving around the screen with different enemy types spawning in, firing bullets, and trying to hit the player. We thought this would be simple to make, as well as easy to iterate and expand on, since we could make several types of enemies fairly quickly once the base framework was set up.

We stayed up throughout the entire night creating new features for the game. One of my favourite moments was pair programming a rework of the entire difficulty system, to make enemies spawn in based on time passed. I also loved seeing how all the different enemy types came together and the unique ideas we implemented. It was a lot of fun working with my friends on a fun, fast-paced, and interesting project like this.
